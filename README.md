## Accessibility
Digital Promise champions an inclusive community where accessibility is paramount.  We believe that everyone, regardless of ability, should be empowered to create and share content using technology. Recognizing that disabilities are a natural part of the human experience – encompassing permanent, temporary, and situational limitations – we prioritize accessibility to ensure our work reflects our core values.  In today's digitally interconnected world, accessible technology is essential for full participation, and Digital Promise is committed to being a leader in this movement. Therefore, we have committed to frequent, in-house, UX/UI audits based on the WCAG accessibility rating system. Any updates to the code base that improve product accessibility will be noted in the Badge Engine changelog.
